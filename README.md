# odom_ufmg_case

Repository with the necessary files to generate different types of odometry from bags recorded in UFMG with EspeleoRob√¥.

The recorded bags were recorded on February 2020. The output of this repository is the publication of six different localization techniques: wheel, wheel+imu, visual, lidar, uwb and uwb+imu.


## Correcting the bags

First, it is necessary to correct the bag's content by running the node *correct_node*, which is represented by the file *necessary_files/scripts/correct_bag_ufmg.py*. It is used to create another bag with the correct configurations for the topics used in odometry generation:

* */cmd_vel (geometry_msgs/Twist)*
* */decawave/tag_pose (espeleo_decawave/Tag)*
* */deviceX/get_joint_state (sensor_msgs/JointState)*
* */imu/data (sensor_msgs/Imu)*
* */laser_odom_to_init (nav_msgs/Odometry)*
* */integrated_to_init (nav_msgs/Odometry)*
* */os1_cloud_node/points (sensor_msgs/PointCloud2)*
* */robot_odom (nav_msgs/Odometry)*
* */realsense/gyro/sample (nav_msgs/Odometry)*
* */realsense/accel/sample (nav_msgs/Odometry)*
* */realsense/odom/sample (nav_msgs/Odometry)*
* */tf (tf2_msgs/TFMessage)*

Part of these topics were not recorded in some the bags and must be run offline, when possible. This node just republish many of these topics, except for:
*/decawave/tag_pose* - added an Odometry message
*/imu/data* - added a TF message
*/robot_odom* - fixed its covariance
*/realsense/gyro/sample* and */realsense/accel/sample* - merged into an Imu message
*/realsense/odom/sample* - used to create a Clock message
*/tf* - used to generate a Pose Message for estimation (UWB+IMU).

The main parameters of this node can be edited in the file, where:

* *input_file*: represents the complete name for the input bags.
* *output_file*: represents the name for the output bag.


## Odometry

The process for each odometry is presented in th following.


### Wheel Odometry

Up to three nodes are required to generate wheel odometry:

* *joints_node*: When the joints states were not recorded, it publishes */deviceX/get_joint_state* from */cmd_vel*.

* *odom_node*: When the wheel odometry was not computed online, it publishes the topic */robot_odom* from */deviceX/get_joint_state*.

* *output_wheel_node*: Changes */robot_odom* to desired frames, publishing it in */wheel/odom*.


### Wheel-EKF Odometry

Two nodes are required for wheel-EKF odometry:

* *robot_pose_ekf*: Uses Extended Kalman Filter for combining */robot_odom* and */imu/data* into the topic */robot_pose_ekf/odom_combined*.

* *output_wheel_ekf_node*: Changes */robot_pose_ekf/odom_combined* to desired frames, publishing it in */wheel_ekf/odom*.


### Visual Odometry

As visual odometry has always been computed online, only one node is required:

* *output_visual_node*: Changes */realsense/odom/sample* to desired frames, publishing it in */visual/odom*.


### LiDAR Odometry

For LiDAR odometry, one package and two nodes are required:

* *lego_loam*:  Using */os1_cloud_node/points* (and */imu/data*), this package publishes a simple LiDAR Odometry in */laser_odom_to_init* and a combined LiDAR+IMU Odometry in */integrated_to_init*

* *output_lidar_noimu_node*: Changes */laser_odom_to_init* to desired frames, publishing it in */lidar_noimu/odom*.

* *output_lidar_node*: Changes */integrated_to_init* to desired frames, publishing it in */lidar/odom*.


### UWB Localization Method

The only node required for localization method using UWB:

* *output_uwb_node*: Changes */decawave/odom* (created in *correct_node*) to desired frames, publishing it in */uwb/odom*.


### UWB-EKF Odometry

Two nodes are required for UWB-EKF odometry:

* *state_estimator_decawave*: Uses Extended Kalman Filter for combining linear velocity from */cmd_vel*, position from */decawave/pose* and gyroscope from */imu/data*, publishing it in */espeleo/pose*.

* *output_uwb_ekf_node*: Changes */espeleo/pose* to desired frames, publishing it in */uwb_ekf/odom*.


### Rviz View

Finally, for visualization of the whole process, the node *rviz_node* opens RViz with a correct configuration for topics and view.


## Building

The commands for built the package are simple:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafaelfgs/odom_ufmg_case.git
cd ..
catkin build
source devel/setup.bash
```

Note: *catkin build* can be replaced by *catkin_make*.


## Running

First, it is necessary to correct the bags, running the first node with the command:

```bash
rosrun required_files odom_ufmg_case.py
```

To simplify the command for the cited nodes, a *.launch* file can be used for running all of them (except for *odom_ufmg_case*), through the commands:

```bash
rosbag play PATH_TO_FILE.bag
roslaunch required_files odom_ufmg_case.launch 
```

### Parameters of *.launch* file

As many bags do not hold some topics, four boolean arguments were created to select the necessary nodes of the repository:

*joints*: true for bags that contain */deviceX/get_joint_state* (it is false only in corridor experiments)
*robot_odom*: true for bags that contain */robot_odom* (it is true only in hall experiments)
*loam*: true for bags that contain */laser_odom_to_init* and */integrated_to_init* (it is true only in hall experiments)
*estimation*: true for bags that contain */espeleo/pose* (it is true only in hall experiments)

Another important parameter is the transform from world to the robot initial pose. The vector with position and quaternion of each experiment are:

*[0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0174524 0.9998477]*: for the experiment in the closed path
*[1.0 1.08 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0]*: for the experiment in the corridor
*[0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0]*: for the experiment in the hall

The sensors' transforms and the name of the sensors' topics are also presented as argument, and can be modified as desired.
